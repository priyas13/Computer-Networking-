# Physical layer : 
Physical layer is the most complex part of computer networking. It takes care of converting 0s and 1s. Computers communicate in zeros and ones which are known 
as bits. Physical layer is responsible for sending 1s and 0s from one end of the link to another. A copper cable, once connected to device 
on both ends, will carry a constant electrical charge. These electric charge represent 0s and 1s. 
## Bit : 
The smallest representation of data that a computer can understand that is 0s and 1s.
## Modulation :
Process of sending 1s and 0s across the network cables. It allows the devices on either end of a link to understand the electric 
charge in a state that is whether it represents 0s or 1s.
## Twisted Pair Cabling and Duplexing :
The most common form of cabling is twisted pair. It is called twisted because pair of copper wires are twisted together. Twisted 
feature prevents interference. Communication can be one direction or in both direction. For example, phone calls are bidirectional 
while computer application like web page is one way communication.
