# Hubs and Switches
## Hub: Hub is a physical layer device that allows for connections from many computers at once. All the devices connected to a hub can communicate
with each other at the same time. There may be multiple devices on a network where a single computer is trying to communicate with a particular computer in the network.
All the other computers in the network has to ignore that message. These situation create lot of noise in the system and lead to collision domain.

## Collision domain: A network segment where only one device can communicate at a time.

Hence hubs are known to run into such problem.

## Network switch: It has the same purpose as hub but hub represents a physical layer device and switch represents a data link layer.
Switch can sense the data being transmitted and only propogates the data to the expected receiver of it. It avoids collision and make the 
system fast.
