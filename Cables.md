# Cables
Lots of different kinds of cables and network devices are used to allow computers to communicate with each other.

*Cables connect different devices to each other, allowing data to be transmitted over them*. Cables are of two forms: copper or fiber.

**Copper cables** : Copper cables are made up of copper wires inside a plastic. As we all know computer operates in binary that is 0 and 1. Sending devices communicate binary data across these copper wires by changing the voltage between two ranges.
The system at the receiving end then decode these voltages received as binaries and transmit these data to the machine. The most common copper cables used are cat5, cat6 and cat5e

**Fiber cables** : Contains individual optical fibers, which are tiny tubes made out of glass about the width of human hair. Fiber cables uses lights to represent 1s and 0s. These can transmit data much faster than copper cables but are expensive.
