# Firewall
Network should be secure. Firewall is a device that blocks traffic that meets certain criteria. It can stop a traffic from entering
into the network. Firewall can be present in various layers like it might block traffic in application layer or in transport layer.

Firewall in transport layer blocks traffic from going to certain port and directs traffic to certain port. For example, if any network
in a company has two ports, at one port the webpage of the company is available and at one port the confidential data is present.
Now if anyone is trying to access the webpage of the company then firewall will allow the traffic to enter the specific port but if 
anyone is trying to access the confidential data then firewall will block the traffic. 
 
Firewall is placed at certain perimeter of the network. It is not dependent on the network devices. Firewall can run on individual hosts
instead of being a network device. Operating systems have firewall functionality built-in.
