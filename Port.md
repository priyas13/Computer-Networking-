# Port
Port is a logical channel through which data can be sent/received to an application. Any host may have multiple application running,
and each of its application is identified using the port number on which they are running on. It is generally a 16 bit integer.

**netstat -a** lists all the ports being used.

# Socket
The combination of port number and IP address is called socket.

**nslookup** gives us the IP address of the domain we are looking for. Like nslookup www.google.com (Domain Name System)
