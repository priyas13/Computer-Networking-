# Network layer
 - IP addresses are 32 bit long numbers made up of 4 octets. IP addresses belong to the networks, not the devices attached to the network.
 - A laptop has a fixed MAC address (hardware address) but not a fix IP address. If we have the laptop connected to a network at a cafe, then the IP addess changes and it is not the same when connected to the home network. LAN at cafe and LAN at home are responsible for handing the IP addresses to the computer. It is a unique string of numbers separated by periods that identifes each computer using the Internet protocol
to communicate over the network.
- On a local network or LAN. nodes can communicate with each other through their physical MAC addresses. This works well on small scale because switches can easily learn MAC addresses of other computers. But it is not possible to know the MAC addresses of any system on the planet because they are not arranged in any systematic order. There comes the use of ARP.
- **Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol** 
A protocol which describes the method of assigning the IP addresses to computers by different LANs. 
- **Static IP addresses**
Static IP addresses is assigned for the servers and network devices.
- **Dynamic IP addresses**
Dynamic IP addresses is assigned for the clients.
- **ARP**
A protocol used to discover the hardware address of a node with a certain IP address.
- **ARP table**
List of IP addresses and the MAC addresses associated with them.

* hostname gives the name of the internet provider for the machine.
