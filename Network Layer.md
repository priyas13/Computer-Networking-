# Network layer
IP addresses are 32 bit long numbers made up of 4 octets. IP addresses belong to the networks, not the devices attached to the network.
A laptop has a fixed MAC address (hardware address) but not a fix IP address. If we have the laptop connected to a network at a cafe, then the IP
addess changes and it is not the same when connected to the home network. LAN at cafe and LAN at home are responsible for handing the 
IP addresses to the computer. It is a unique string of numbers separated by periods that identifes each computer using the Internet protocol
to communicate over the network.
## Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol 
A protocol which describes the method of assigning the IP addresses to computers by different LANs.

## ARP :
A protocol used to discover the hardware address of a node with a certain IP address.

## ARP table :
List of IP addresses and the MAC addresses associated with them.

* hostname gives the name of the internet provider for the machine.
