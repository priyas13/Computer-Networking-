# Routers 
Router is a device which help us to forward data between independent devices. Router works at the network layer. It inspect IP data to
determine where to send things. Routers store information in internal tables about how to route traffic between lots of different 
networks all over the world. The router we use at home keep information about the traffic orginating from inside the home and forward it 
to the Internet service provider. Core router forms the backbone of the internet. The protocol for routers is called BGP (Border Gateway Protocol).
Through this protocol, router learn how to use optimal paths to send a data across the network. For example, when we open a web browser
in our computer and load a webpage, the traffic between computers and the web server could have traveled over dozens of different routers.
