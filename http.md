**World wide web** is combination of all the resources and users on the internet that is using **Hypertext Transfer Protocol**. Http is the 
protocol used by world wide web. It is a response-request protocol in the client-server computing model. For example, a web browser may be a 
client and an application running on a computer hosting a website may be the server. The client that is our web browser like chrome,
internet explorer etc. submits an HTTP request message to the server. The server, which provides the resources such as HTML files and
other content, or performs other functions on behalf of client, returns a response message to the client. 

**HTTP** is a protocol defined to serve in the application layer. It is designed to enable communication between clients and servers.

There are multiple entity like router, cables etc. but these all are hidden in the lower level.

The traditional port for http is Port 80. For example, suppose we want to request the webpage from a web server running on computer listening on IP 10.1.1.100, the traffic would be directed to port 80 on that computer. Ports are normally donated with a colon after the IP address ad 10.1.1.100:80. The complete address with port number is called socket number.
