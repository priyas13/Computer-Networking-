# Application layer
 - Application layer is the only layer with which users interact. 
 - Payload contains the actual data that needs to be send or received. It can be the content of the web browser or the video      content.
 - There are many different protocols in application layer like http. There are lots of differnt web browser like chrome, internet explore etc which have their own protocols. Similarly there are many servers and clients. The most famour servers are Apache, Microsoft IIS, and nginx. All of them need to speak the same protocol. Hence no matter which browser we are using, they can communicate with any server and each server speak the same protocol. For web traffic, the application layer protocol is http.
 - Web browser generally act as clients and web server as servers. All the web browser must speak the same protocol. Any browser we are using if all of them speak the same protocol then we might be able to contact the server using any one of them.
